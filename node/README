Main or entry file
------------------
Use node-test as your main or entry point. This is not a requirement though. You can use any suitable entry point. This is an example.

Compiling your coffee script files and running your node application
--------------------------------------------------------------------

All CoffeScript source files are kept under node/src

To compile your CoffeeScript source files under src and output them under target do:

coffee -co target src

Including a submodule from another module
-----------------------------------------

To include a submodule in another module, require it in your module using the APPROOT as the path to your application

e.g.

APPROOT = require('app-root-path')
submodule = require"#{APPROOT}/target/[path to submodule]"

Notice we are requiring the generated Javascript file not the CoffeeScript file that was used to generate it.

Running your application
------------------------

node target/lib/node-test.js


Installing a node package to use with your application
------------------------------------------------------

npm install [package-name] --save

Note: Use --save so that the version number is captured and the package maintained through package.json
